Volunteer information: If you would like to volunteer, email philadelphiacommunityfridge@gmail.com with your name, pronouns, email address, and phone number. Our two main volunteer needs are people who can clean/sanitize the fridge on a daily basis, and people who can purchase or pickup food and transport it to the fridge. However, we have lots of other volunteer positions and are always looking for more volunteers to support the fridge!

Mission statement:
We're a community-centered, volunteer-based organization
dedicated to giving all Philadelphians access to fresh and healthy
food, combatting food insecurity and inequality in our city
through mutual aid.

Studies show that nearly 1 in 5 Philadelphia families struggle
with hunger, and food pantries' demand for fresh produce has
increased 3x since 2019.

We partner with local grocers and restaurants to stock this
fridge with perfectly good produce, pantry staples, and prepared
foods that would otherwise be thrown out.

BEING ABLE TO FEED YOURSELF AND
YOUR FAMILY ISN'T A PRIVILEGE â€”
IT'S A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT.

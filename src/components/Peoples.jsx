                    <p>Our vision is to provide community members with fresh food and essentials as a free resource. On one level, The Peopleâ€™s Fridge is a way to combat hunger in underserved communities during a pandemic and an economic crisis. We believe that food is a human right and should never be a privilege, but it is. This community fridge is a mutual aid, meaning, community members have equal responsibility filling, maintaining, and caring for it lovingly. Our fridge runs on a â€˜take what you need, leave what you don'tâ€™ basis. Part of our purpose is to create a resource people can fall back on, trust, and rely on to be there without repercussions. <br/>The People's Fridge is dedicated in memory of our father, Kalpesh Parikh.</p>
